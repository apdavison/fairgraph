**fairgraph** is a Python library for working with metadata
in the EBRAINS Knowledge Graph, with a particular focus on data reuse,
although it is also useful in metadata registration/curation.
The API is not stable, and is subject to change.

## Installation

To get the latest release:

```
pip install fairgraph
```

To get the development version:

```
git clone https://github.com/HumanBrainProject/fairgraph.git
pip install -U ./fairgraph
```

## Knowledge Graph versions

This version of fairgraph supports version 3 of the EBRAINS Knowledge Graph (KG).

## Basic setup

The basic idea of the library is to represent metadata nodes from the Knowledge Graph as Python objects.
Communication with the Knowledge Graph service is through a client object,
for which an access token associated with an EBRAINS account is needed.

If you are working in a Collaboratory Jupyter notebook, the client will find your token automatically.

If working outside the Collaboratory, we recommend you obtain a token from whichever authentication endpoint
is available to you, and save it as an environment variable so the client can find it, e.g. at a shell prompt:

```
export KG_AUTH_TOKEN=eyJhbGci...nPq
```

You can then create the client object:

```
>>> from fairgraph import KGClient

>>> client = KGClient(host="core.kg.ebrains.eu")
```

You can also pass the token explicitly to the client:

```
>>> client = KGClient(token)
```


## Retrieving metadata from the Knowledge Graph

The Knowledge Graph uses [openMINDS](https://github.com/HumanBrainProject/openMINDS) schemas.
Each openMINDS schema corresponds to a Python class, which are grouped into modules
following the openMINDS structure. For example:

```
>>> from fairgraph.openminds.core import DatasetVersion
>>> from fairgraph.openminds.controlled_terms import Technique
```

The following openMINDS modules are currently available: `core`, `controlled_terms`, `sands`, `computation`, `chemicals`, `specimen_prep`, `ephys`, `publications`, `stimulation`.
Using these classes, it is possible to list all metadata matching a particular criterion, e.g.

```
>>> patch_techniques = Technique.list(client, name="patch clamp")
>>> print([technique.name for technique in patch_techniques])
['cell attached patch clamp', 'multiple whole cell patch clamp', 'patch clamp', 'patch clamp technique', 'whole cell patch clamp']
>>> whole_cell_patch = patch_techniques[4]
```

```
>>> datasets = DatasetVersion.list(client, techniques=whole_cell_patch, scope="in progress")
```

For research products that are versioned, such as datasets, models, and software, certain attributes may be inherited from the parent (e.g. a DatasetVersion generally inherits its name from a Dataset). In this case, we have a convenience method to retrieve the parent's name:

```
>>> print(datasets[0].get_name(client, scope="in progress"))
'Cholinergic interneurons in the striatum - Single cell patch clamp recordings'
```

If you know the unique identifier of an object, you can retrieve it directly:

```
>>> dataset = DatasetVersion.from_id("17196b79-04db-4ea4-bb69-d20aab6f1d62", client, scope="in progress")
```

Links between metadata in the Knowledge Graph are not followed automatically,
to avoid unnecessary network traffic, but can be followed with the `resolve()` method:

```
>>> license = dataset.license.resolve(client, scope="in progress")
>>> authors = [author.resolve(client, scope="in progress") for author in dataset.authors]
```

The associated metadata is accessible as attributes of the Python objects, e.g.:

```
>>> print(dataset.version_innovation)
This is the first version of this research product.
```

To print out all the metadata for a given object, use the `show()` method:

```
>>> print(license.show())
id          https://kg.ebrains.eu/api/instances/6ebce971-7f99-4fbc-9621-eeae47a70d85

```

You can also access any associated data:

```
>>> dataset.download(client, local_directory=dataset.alias)
```


## Storing and editing metadata

For those users who have the necessary permissions to store and edit metadata in the Knowledge Graph,
**fairgraph** objects can be created or edited in Python, and then saved back to the Knowledge Graph, e.g.:

```
from datetime import datetime
from fairgraph.openminds.core import Person, Organization, Affiliation

mgm = Organization(name="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer", alias="MGM")
mgm.save(client, space="myspace")

affiliation = Affiliation(organization=mgm, start_date=datetime(1942, 1, 1))
author = Person(family_name="Laurel", given_name="Stan", affiliations=affiliation)
author.save(client, space="myspace")
```
