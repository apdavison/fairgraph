"""
Helpers for matching metadata objects by name.

The first block below is a **verbatim copy** of the helpers that openMINDS generates into
every one of its ``by_name()`` methods. They are closures there, repeated in each of the
406 generated modules, so they cannot be imported. openMINDS_Python PR #106 moves them to
``openminds.base``; once fairgraph requires a release containing it, delete the block and
uncomment the import line, and bump ``openminds>=`` in pyproject.toml.

Everything after the block is fairgraph-specific: it *calls* the helpers above rather than
restating anything they know, so the swap changes no behaviour. 

While the copy is in place, ``TestParityWithOpenMINDS`` in ``test_name_matching.py`` 
guards against it drifting from the original.
